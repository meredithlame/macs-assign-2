# Assignment 2 - Design and Implementation of a Complex System

    Due 11 May by 23:59 Points 100 Available 11 Mar at 0:00 - 14 May at 23:59 2 months

Note: This assignment is to be completed in groups of 1-3 students (i.e., individual submissions are allowed).

 

All group members are expected to contribute equally and marks will be shared. Only one group member is required to submit the assignment but every group member (name and student id) must be listed at the top of the assignment report. If there are problems with your group please let the coordinator know well before the deadline for the assignment.

## Summary

The goal of this assignment is to model a complex system. Each group will select a complex system of their choice and implement it in a programming language of their choice. A programming language particularly well suited for this is NetLogo which was also used in assignment 1 (https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/ (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.), but this is not a mandatory requirement.

 

The complex system should have the following properties:

* Large number of components
* Large number of connections between the components
* Some complexity within the behavior of each of the components
* Several attributes that influence the complex system

 

Obvious examples of a complex system that would be suitable for this assignments include:

* Flock of birds
* Traffic flow
* Emergency departments

## Hand-ins

Each group has to hand in:

* a 5-7 minute long video demonstration showcasing the complex system that has been modeled for this assignment. The video should be uploaded to YouTube as an unlisted video, and the link should be included on the front page of the assignment report.
* A 3-5 page assignment report.
* All source code produced as part of the assignment.

 

Both video and report should cover the following:

* The complex system that the group chose to model: Brief description of what system was chosen and why this would be an interesting system to study
* Why this complex system is a good choice: Brief description of why/how the system fulfils the properties detailed in the summary section
* Technology: Brief description of what technologies the group chose for modeling the complex system and what alternatives were considered
* Design: An overview of the design (software architecture, entity description) of the complex system
* Emergence: An explanation how the group chose to measure emergence in the model and what the group was able to measure. This will require the implementation of at least one metric that measures emergence and an evaluation of its effectiveness through detailed experiments. When using stochastic processes, please make sure you present results from at least 10 runs and that each plot has at least five data points.
* Robustness: An explanation how the group chose to assess the robustness of the model and what the results of this assessment were. This will require using different input values and  analyzing the impact of these values on the complex system.
* Instructions on how to run the system

## Assessment criteria

Submissions will be assessed in terms of:

* 10% Code quality: clarity, simplicity, modularity, formatting, and documentation
* 10% Linkage between model and real system, documented via code comments and in the report
* 10% Clarity of the description in the video and the report
* 5% Usage instructions
* 35% Evidence of emergence measured in the modeled system
* 20% Evidence of robustness of the modeled system
* 10% Complexity of the modeled system -- extra marks will be given to groups who chose more challenging systems to model
